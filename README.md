Prototype
==========================

Generates boilerplate for the command line.

Description
--------------

The command line provides an excellent environment for quickly building tools
that are pluggable, discoverable, easy to use and compose. Prototype makes
portable, robust boilerplate to build:

* Standalone scripts
* Pluggable command sets
* Generic HTTP API clients
* Configuration and ENV setup
* Completions
* Manpages
